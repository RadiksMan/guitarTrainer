### The guitarTrainer service, which I did, will help you to learn the notes on a guitar fretboard.
There is an opportunity:
- choose the type of the neck (each module of the component-griffon is loaded dynamically)
- see all notes on the fretboard
- the duration of the right response
- training with sharps or without
